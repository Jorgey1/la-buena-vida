<h3>Canggu</h3>
<h3>Avenue fitness</h3>
<p>Opening Times: 6AM - 10PM</p>
<p>If you are into fitness and want the best price for a gym facility in canggu we recommend Avenue fitness! We compared prices with other gym are this was the cheapest option for the month we were staying in canggu.</p>
<h4>Positives<h4>
<p>The gym equipment is in great condition with one room dedicated to machines and then the top floor is an aerobic room.</p>
<p>The staff are really friendly and make you feel welcome!</p>
<p>Have 3 classes on a day, at 8.30, 9.30 and 6pm which consist of yoga, body combat, step up, fit cardio and more.</p> 
<p>When classes aren’t on members can still use the room which is filled with equipment.</p>
<p>In the spa the sauna and ice bath are good</p>

<h4>Negatives</h4>
<p>the hot tub didn’t feel very clean and throughout the day people can walk from the gym room through the spa in trainers to access the changing/locker rooms so the floor gets a bit dirty.</p>


<p>There are lots of gyms in Bali such as the body factory, CrossFit and motion fitness which look like they offer better classes and have good reviews but if you are looking for a good budget option whilst still having great gym equipment we recommend Avenue fitness.</p>
<p>The packages they offer are the following:<p>
<ul>
    <li>1 Day Pass - 150k Rupiah / 8£ GBP</li>
    <li>10 Day Pass - 1million Rupiah / 56£ GBP</li>
    <li>1 Month Pass - 1million 200k Rupiah / 66£ GBP</li>
</ul>

Cute shops 

In canggu there are lots of boutique shops selling fashionable cool items. Some of my favourite stores to look in were bamboo blonde, lost island, lovissa next to bamboo blonde, 

Before I got to Bali I thought prices would’ve been cheaper however in these stores clothing will set you back £25 or more. 

There is a market called Love Anchor which is good if you want to get yourself some costume jewellery, a bikini/swimsuit; there is a stand towards the back on the left which sells basic plain swim for 400k and open to bartering and even offer a make to measure service, another swim range is as you come in and go down the first step on the right there is more patterned bikinis going for 550k, crochet bags or straw bags - not too sure on their durability though..just don’t put a lot in but they look boho chic! 

Rip curl/billabong stores are dotted all over and while I was there had some great discounts on up to 50% off - I managed to get a bikini set for £24 which is good for billabong. 


Bali belly 
What is it 
If you haven’t heard of Bali belly.. you need to and you need to prepare!! Bali belly is when you get the following and is down to a bacteria in Bali that is picked up andunfortunately it is very difficult to pinpoint what caused it and when! 

Our Own experience 
We were there for 2 months and got ill on 2 occasions each; one being severe throwing up and retching on and off for a few hours accompanied with diarrhoea which took us three days to recover and feel normal again. Second time was a month later and we had a bad fever, felt really weak and had bad stomach cramps which only lasted a day. 

What to do 
If you get ill and depending how servere you feel you could call a doctor and they can assist you on a drip and guidance (best if you have insurance cover as it is quite pricey) or go to a pharmacy to get advice from the pharmacist. You can get tablets for stomach cramps and for diarrhoea. 

How to prevent it
the key is to keep washing your hands and get some hand sanitizer because bacteria can be picked up easily on your hands from anything you touch
Stay hydrated! We recommend taking diaralyte with you and a drink in Bali called picori sweat which helped us rehydrate, you can find this in most supermarkets. 
Try and drink with straws (environmentally friendly ones of course) and wipe beer bottle tops because often the glasses may carry bacteria. 
Eat and drink at popular restaurants, it’s a bit of a risk and a big no eating at local cheap food stands on the side of the street compared to other places in Asia. 
Before you come to Bali maybe talk to your doctor about if there is a preventive or vaccination against ecoli bacteria 

This obviously doesn’t apply to everyone because we met lucky people who never got Bali belly however it is very likely and if you are only in Bali for a short amount of time the last thing you want is to get ill for a few days.


Ubud 
Monkey forest 80k entry - it has really developed over the last few years from only being 20k! probably spend 20/30 minutes walking round and seeing the monkeys. The monkeys are very cheeky; keep your bag close to you with belongings zipped up and Hold phone tightly just Incase the monkeys try and snatch anything. Also if you get down low to take a photo of a baby monkey watch out for other monkeys climbing on you this happened to me and I froze - I think they thought my hair was a new toy. In this case I learnt to slowly start walking and they will drop and don’t be scared which is easier said than done considering I froze still and started screeching looking helplessly at my boyfriend who looked had no clue and started backing off. But at least the crowd behind me on the walkway found it amusing as they laughed and had their big cameras pointed at me. Later my boyfriend sat down and a monkey came over innocently and then started playing with one of his more expensive bracelets. 
We also saw a girl sat down with her rucksack on the floor and a monkey climbed on her down to her back and decided take ownership of the bag and when the girl tried to get it back the monkey hissed and be defensive but then someone distracting the monkey with some food and dropped the bag. 
Throughout the forest you’ll see the monkeys mainly moving round and playing with eachother and cleaning eachother. Just walk slowly passed
Waterfall - bar next to it 
Rice paddy fields 


Mount Batur
We booked our mount batur trip with a tour office in Ubud or around (price), we got picked up at 2am and then taken to a stop half way to the starting point of the trek for a pancake and coffee/tea which was needed to fuel our next step and wake us up - I would advise against the coffee unless you like your coffee unfiltered with the coffee granules at the bottom. As we got to the starting point in the car park our group were  allocated a tour guide who led us to the top, helped us if we need anything and he carried our breakfast which is included in the price. 
What to expect
The trek itself is quick however the queue of people climbing added to the time; we could see the trail ahead lit up by everyone’s flashlights. The start of the trek is easy but as it gets a bit steeper the terrain gets pretty  rocky making it easier to skid and loose your footing especially in trainers; Which can be a bit scary in the dark as you can’t really see what is surrounding you. When you get close to the top you have an option of watching sunrise at the first viewing point or continue going  to the very top which is 20 minutes further. As much as I was done with skidding and got comfortable sat down at the first stop our group powered on to the top and it was definitely a better view, we were very lucky with the clarity as we could see as far as the Gili islands and Lombok. we sat and ate our overboiled eggs and a dry slice of white bread handed to us by the guide. On the way down it was equally as skiddy, one girl we passed was sat in tears as she had sprained her ankle :( accidents do happen so need to take it easy! Saying that there were young Balinese local school children running confidently up and down making it look like a walk in the park. We were so thankful for our guide as he helped everyone with a hand so they didnt lose their footing and to move us swiftly down. once you pass this part and get back on to the pavement the walk is very scenic with green fields of crops surrounding you as you make it back to the car park. 

Now time to nap on the way back to your accommodation! 

recommend things to take 
- water bottle
- walking shoes / good pair of trainers 
- a few layers; it is chilly in the morning when standing around and there was a breeze as we climbed higher so i would take a few layers if you feel the cold, however when the sun rises you will be warm in a tshirt as you make your way down.
- A tasty snack to have at the top when watching sunrise as the egg and bread is a bit bland, nevertheless a good source of protein 
- good camera 
- Head torch - we were all given handheld torches and there were a few head torches going but if you have one of your own may as well bring it

Town is developing, not much going on. Only a handful of restaurants to choose from such as ... and even Starbucks which is in a newlywed built complex. 
In town there is molas cafe where we spent most of our time as it had good WiFi, a pool and a good menu! 
We opted for a day trip, couldn’t recommend seek Sophie enough, amazing communication on WhatsApp with an advisor to answer our questions throughout the booking process. they picked us up from our hotel in the morning however we didn’t get transport back to our hotel after the trip and that was supposed to be included so I would definitely confirm a return journey with them; we got off the boat confused as to where to go and had to Batar with guys on motorbikes outside the port who were eager to offer us a lift, all of who had no idea where our hotel was and our phones were dead so felt a bit hopeless. Finally someone knew where it was and hurrah we were on our way after a long day! it happened to be only 2 minutes away. It would’ve been helpful if our phones were charged so we knew - highly recommend getting a portable charger 
To make your trip more enjoyable we would recommend spending that little bit more in accommodation. Due to our budget we opted to stay at ... which was cheap but cane with a lot of faults such as smelly bathroom/shower room, bed sheets smelling etc. When we were looking for accommodation the nicer, better value for money  was booked up so make sure you book 3-5 weeks in advanced, especially in the busier season.
