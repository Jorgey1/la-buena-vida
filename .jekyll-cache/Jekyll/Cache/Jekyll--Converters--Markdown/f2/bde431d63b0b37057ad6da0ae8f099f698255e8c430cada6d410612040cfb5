Town is developing, not much going on. Only a handful of restaurants to choose from such as ... and even Starbucks which is in a newlywed built complex. 
In town there is molas cafe where we spent most of our time as it had good WiFi, a pool and a good menu! 
We opted for a day trip, couldn’t recommend seek Sophie enough, amazing communication on WhatsApp with an advisor to answer our questions throughout the booking process. they picked us up from our hotel in the morning however we didn’t get transport back to our hotel after the trip and that was supposed to be included so I would definitely confirm a return journey with them; we got off the boat confused as to where to go and had to Batar with guys on motorbikes outside the port who were eager to offer us a lift, all of who had no idea where our hotel was and our phones were dead so felt a bit hopeless. Finally someone knew where it was and hurrah we were on our way after a long day! it happened to be only 2 minutes away. It would’ve been helpful if our phones were charged so we knew - highly recommend getting a portable charger 
To make your trip more enjoyable we would recommend spending that little bit more in accommodation. Due to our budget we opted to stay at ... which was cheap but cane with a lot of faults such as smelly bathroom/shower room, bed sheets smelling etc. When we were looking for accommodation the nicer, better value for money  was booked up so make sure you book 3-5 weeks in advanced, especially in the busier season.<p>
